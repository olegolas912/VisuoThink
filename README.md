Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models have showcased remarkable capabilities. However, they often falter when confronted with complex reasoning tasks that humans typically address through visual aids and deliberate, step-by-step thinking. While existing methods have explored text-based slow thinking or rudimentary visual assistance, they fall short of capturing the intricate, interleaved nature of human visual-verbal reasoning processes. To overcome these limitations and inspired by the mechanisms of slow thinking in human cognition, we introduce **VisuoThink**, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates visuospatial and linguistic domains. **VisuoThink** facilitates multimodal slow thinking by enabling progressive visual-textual reasoning and incorporates test-time scaling through look-ahead tree search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that **VisuoThink** significantly enhances reasoning capabilities via inference-time scaling, even without fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance in tasks involving geometry and spatial reasoning.

## Quick Start

1. Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set up the `config.py` file under `visual-navigation/` as follows:

```python
import os

# set up the agent max reasoning steps
MAX_REPLY = 10

os.environ["AUTOGEN_USE_DOCKER"] = "False"

MODEL_NAME = os.environ.get("MODEL_NAME", "gpt-4o")
API_KEY = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")


llm_config={"cache_seed": None, "config_list": [{"model": MODEL_NAME, "temperature": 0.0, "api_key": API_KEY}]}
```

3. Run the visual navigation tasks:

- To run the visual navigation with VisuoThink, you can use the following command:

```bash
python visual-navigation/run_task_nav.py --verbose --visual
# alternatively, you can use the --tree_search flag to enable multimodal tree search
```

- To run the visual navigation with CoT with Executor, you can use the following command:

```bash
python visual-navigation/run_task_nav.py --verbose
```

- To run the visual navigation with CoT, you can use the following command:

```bash
python visual-navigation/run_task_nav.py --verbose --visual --run_tag cot
```

## Benchmarks

- Visual Tiling and Geometry (Geometry3k & Geomverse)'s Google Drive links will be available soon.
